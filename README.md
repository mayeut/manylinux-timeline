## Policy for dropping python versions

- Python versions will be kept at least 2 years after EOL
- Python versions will be dropped 4 years after EOL at the latest
- Between those two dates, versions will be dropped if their overall download proportion at the beginning of the graph is less than 3%

This can be summed-up as:
